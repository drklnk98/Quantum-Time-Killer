# Quantum-Time-Killer
Fun little app with some basic games to play with coworkers when there's no internet.

This idea was inspired by having the absolute bare minimum to do at work for months on end, and, since there was limited internet access, the only way to pass the time was by playing games. At first, I played a lot of Microsoft Solitare until I got in trouble (oopsie). My coworkers and I started playing basic games using MS Paint. It was fun enough and it worked but I got tired of the trouble of using the touchscreen. I thought if I could make these games text-based, it would be easier than drawing, erasing, reloading, etc.

Some of the games we played were hangman and connect 4. Personally, I really would have liked to play chess. It would be great to add more in the future.
